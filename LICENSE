You're free to use this code for perspective tracking with Aegisub.
It is not recommended to try to use it for other things, like controlling the autopilot of an airplane.
  ^ I don't take responsibility in that case.
   It might be good to make sandwiches with, but it's not tested for that, therefore not endorsed. 
This code comes as-is, with no guarantee or warranty.
You're free to make feature requests, pull requests and create issues, but they're not guaranteed to be added/fixed.
You're free to use parts of this code that were written by me, without my explicit permission, 
  but you HAVE TO CREDIT ME.(making this took a lot of time, y'know? Failing to credit me might lead 
  to legal action[it probably wont, unless you sell it for billions of $$$]) 
Oh right, no part of this code can be distributed commercially, you can't pay for it, or sell it.
